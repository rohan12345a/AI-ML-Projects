Food Detection and Recipe Generator
This project aims to detect various types of food items using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and provide corresponding recipes for the recognized food items. It utilizes the power of computer vision and natural language processing to create an interactive food detection and recipe generation system.

Features
Food Detection: The trained CNN model can accurately identify different food items from input images.
Recipe Generation: Once the food item is detected, the system generates recipes based on the recognized food item.
User-Friendly Interface: The project is deployed on Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
Easy Deployment: The model and the application are easily deployable, allowing users to utilize the system without complicated setup processes.
