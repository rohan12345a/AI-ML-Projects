High-Range Smartphone Classification
This project focuses on the classification of high-range smartphones based on their features such as RAM, ROM, camera quality, battery capacity, and more. 
We utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) methodologies 
to assign weights to these features and determine the overall ranking of the smartphones.
